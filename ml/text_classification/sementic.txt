🧠 What is Word2Vec?
Word2Vec is a technique that helps a computer understand what words mean by turning them into numbers.

 Why use it?
Because computers don’t understand words, they only understand numbers.
Word2Vec helps by converting each word into a vector (a list of numbers), where:

Similar words have similar vectors

Example: "king" and "queen" will be close together in the vector space.

🔍 How does it work?
It learns from text (like books or articles) using one of two methods:

CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
Predicts the current word from nearby words.
Example: "The ___ barks" → guesses "dog".

Skip-gram
Predicts nearby words from the current word.
Example: "dog" → predicts "The", "barks"
 In short:
Word2Vec = turns words into smart numbers so machines can understand and work with language.
