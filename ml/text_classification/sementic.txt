🧠 What is Word2Vec?
Word2Vec is a technique that helps a computer understand what words mean by turning them into numbers.

 Why use it?
Because computers don’t understand words, they only understand numbers.
Word2Vec helps by converting each word into a vector (a list of numbers), where:

Similar words have similar vectors

Example: "king" and "queen" will be close together in the vector space.

🔍 How does it work?
It learns from text (like books or articles) using one of two methods:

CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
Predicts the current word from nearby words.
Example: "The ___ barks" → guesses "dog".

Skip-gram
Predicts nearby words from the current word.
Example: "dog" → predicts "The", "barks"
 In short:
Word2Vec = turns words into smart numbers so machines can understand and work with language.


🌟 Imagine a sentence:
"The cat sits on the mat"

🟩 1. CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
📌 Goal:
Guess the middle word using the words around it.

🧠 Think like this:

If you know the words around a blank, can you guess the missing word?

Example:

Input: ["The", "sits", "on"]

Output: "cat"

📦 So CBOW takes context words → predicts center word

🟨 2. Skip-gram
📌 Goal:
Guess the surrounding words using the center word.

🧠 Think like this:

If you know one word, can you guess the words around it?


🎯 Summary (like a game):
CBOW: "Given neighbors, guess the center word"

Skip-gram: "Given center word, guess the neighbors"
🤝 What is Cosine Similarity?
Cosine similarity is a way to measure how similar two words are — based on their Word2Vec vectors.

It tells us how close the meanings of two words are.

📏 How does it work?
Imagine each word is a point (vector) in space — like a direction.

Cosine similarity checks the angle between two word vectors.

Smaller angle → more similar

Bigger angle → less similar

💡 Formula (Don't worry, just idea):
text
Copy code
cosine_similarity = cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
Where:

A and B are word vectors

· is dot product

||A|| and ||B|| are magnitudes

🧠 Why use it in Word2Vec?
Let’s say you have these word vectors:

"king" → [0.7, 0.2, ...]

"queen" → [0.69, 0.22, ...]

"apple" → [0.1, -0.8, ...]

Cosine similarity will say:

king vs queen → Similar → High cosine value (like 0.95)

king vs apple → Not similar → Low cosine value (like 0.2)



🎯 Simple Summary:
Cosine similarity tells how close two words are in meaning by comparing their directions in vector space.
