#like what is machine learning
# Definition: Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

✅ How Training and Testing Works in Machine Learning
We split data into parts to train the model and test how well it performs:

Data Split	Purpose
X_train	Input features used for training
X_test	Input features used for testing
y_train	Target/output for training
y_test	Target/output for testing

i have define here the menaing of the machine learnig and the dat aspliting here

now what is the mean  and use of the recall that i have defined here 
Recall – What It Is & Why It's Used:
Recall (also called Sensitivity or True Positive Rate) measures how well a model identifies all actual positive cases.

🧠 Formula:
Recall
=
True Positives
True Positives
+
False Negatives
Recall= 
True Positives+False Negatives
True Positives
​
 
📌 Use Case:
Use recall when missing a positive case is costly.

🩺 Example (Medical test):
If you're building a model to detect cancer:

You must catch all real cancer cases (positives),

Even if some healthy people get wrongly flagged (false positives),

So you want high recall.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Precision – What It Is & Why It's Used:
Precision measures how many of the predicted positive results are actually correct.

🧠 Formula:
Precision
=
True Positives
True Positives
+
False Positives
Precision= 
True Positives+False Positives
True Positives
​
 
📌 Use Case:
Use precision when false positives are costly or dangerous.

💼 Example (Spam Filter):
If a spam filter marks a real email as spam (false positive), that's bad.

You want only true spam marked as spam → high precision.

🔁 Summary:
Metric	Focuses On	Important When...
Precision	Correctness of positives	False positives are costly (e.g., email)
Recall	Catching all positives	Missing positives is risky (e.g., cancer)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 F1-Score – Definition & Use
F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, used to measure a model’s overall accuracy when both false positives and false negatives matter.

🧠 Formula:
F1-Score
=
2
×
Precision
×
Recall
Precision
+
Recall
F1-Score=2× 
Precision+Recall
Precision×Recall
​
 
📌 Use Case:
Use F1-score when:

You want a balance between precision and recall.

Your data is imbalanced (e.g., fraud detection, rare disease).

🔍 Example:
If your model has:

High precision but low recall → F1 will be moderate.

High recall but low precision → F1 will also be moderate.

Only when both are high → F1-score is high.
