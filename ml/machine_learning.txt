#like what is machine learning
# Definition: Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

âœ… How Training and Testing Works in Machine Learning
We split data into parts to train the model and test how well it performs:

Data Split	Purpose
X_train	Input features used for training
X_test	Input features used for testing
y_train	Target/output for training
y_test	Target/output for testing
