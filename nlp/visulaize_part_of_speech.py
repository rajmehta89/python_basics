#What you'll see:
# Words are shown with arrows connecting them, showing their relationships.

# POS tags (like NOUN, VERB) are shown above each word.

# It's an easy way to understand sentence structure and word roles visually.

# Let me know if you're running it in VS Code or another environment, Iâ€™ll adjust the method for that.
