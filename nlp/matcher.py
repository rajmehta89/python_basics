#Great! You're exploring spaCy's Matcher, and you're absolutely on the right track.

# Let‚Äôs break it all down simply so you understand what Matcher is, how it works, and why it‚Äôs useful in NLP.

# üîç What is Matcher in spaCy?
# The Matcher is a rule-based pattern matcher in spaCy.

# It lets you search for specific sequences of tokens (words) in text ‚Äî based on:

# text

# part-of-speech

# punctuation

# lemma

# lowercase forms

# etc.

# üìå Why use Matcher?
# You use it when you want to find custom patterns in text like:

# Specific phrases (like ‚Äúsolar power‚Äù, ‚Äúdata science‚Äù)

# Word combinations (like adjective + noun)

# Named expressions not covered by NER

# Custom search in legal/medical/technical texts


#so here you can see how the matcher is basiclaly used here what is teh concern ehind that to use  matcher 
#for sometimes domain specific knowledge and here

# Summary (Why Matcher is useful in NLP):
# Helps custom search in text using flexible rules

# Useful when NER doesn't cover your use case

# Perfect for domain-specific phrase detection

# Supports combining rules: POS, punctuation, lemma, etc. 


#here we are setting callback=None here

#we can remove also the matcher here basically here
